                <p><span className=" text-3xl font-bold">Solar power</span>, also known as solar electricity, is the conversion of energy from<br></br> sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV)<br></br>  or indirectly using concentrated solar power. Solar panels use the photovoltaic<br></br>  effect to convert light into an electric current.[2] Concentrated solar power <br></br> systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a<br></br>  hot spot, often to drive a steam turbine.<br></br> 

                 Photovoltaics (PV) were initially solely used as a <br></br> source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications, <br></br> from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to<br></br>  remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system.<br></br>  Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first <br></br> developed in the 1980s. Since then, as the cost of solar panels has fallen,<br></br>  grid-connected solar PV systems' capacity and production <br></br> has doubled about every three years. Three-quarters <br></br> of new generation capacity is solar,[3] with both millions of<br></br>  rooftop installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic<br></br>  power stations continuing to be built.<br></br> 
                 
                 In 2023, solar was over 1% of primary energy and generated <br></br> 6% of the world's electricity,[4] compared to 1% in 2015, when the Paris<br></br>  Agreement to limit climate change was signed.[5] Along with onshore wind, in most countries, <br></br> the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations is utility-scale solar.[6][7]<br></br> 
                 
                 Almost half the solar power installed in 2022<br></br>  was rooftop.[8] Much more low-carbon power is needed for <br></br> electrification and to limit climate change.[3] The International Energy Agency said in 2022 that<br></br>  more effort was needed for grid integration and the mitigation of policy,<br></br>  regulation and financing challenges.[9] Nevertheless <br></br> solar may greatly cut the cost of energy.[4]<br></br> </p>
